## The San Blas to Cartagena Route

One of the most iconic sailing routes in the Caribbean connects the San Blas Islands of Panama to Cartagena, Colombia. Every year, thousands of travelers — backpackers, digital nomads, and adventure seekers — make this journey by sailboat, skipping the impossible Darién Gap by sea.

This guide covers everything you need to know, from booking your boat to what to pack, and why **Sapzurro** should be your must-visit stopover along the way.

## Why Sail Instead of Fly?

Sure, you could fly from Panama City to Cartagena in about 90 minutes. But here's why the sailing route is worth every minute:

- **San Blas Islands** — Spend 2-3 days island-hopping through pristine, uninhabited islands with crystal-clear water
- **The adventure** — This is a bucket-list experience that combines open-ocean sailing with Caribbean paradise
- **The community** — You'll meet fellow travelers from all over the world
- **The cost** — Surprisingly comparable to flying when you factor in island accommodation

## The Typical Route

Most sailboats follow a similar itinerary:

### Day 1: Panama City to San Blas
You'll depart early morning by 4x4 from your hostel in Panama City. The drive to the coast takes about 3 hours, followed by a short boat ride to the islands.

### Days 2-3: San Blas Islands
Two full days of pure paradise. Snorkeling, swimming, lounging on deserted islands, and sleeping on the boat under the stars. The Guna Yala indigenous communities manage these islands, and their hospitality is legendary.

### Day 4: Open Ocean Crossing
The big crossing day. Depending on conditions, this can take 12-36 hours. The open Caribbean sea can be rough, so prepare accordingly if you're prone to seasickness.

### Day 5: Arrival in Colombia
You'll arrive at the Colombian coast — and this is where it gets interesting. Most boats stop in **Sapzurro** before continuing to Cartagena.

## Why Sapzurro is the Perfect Stopover

After days on a sailboat, Sapzurro is exactly what you need. This tiny fishing village sits right on the Panama-Colombia border, offering:

- **Firm ground** — After the open ocean, walking on solid land feels incredible
- **Playa Bonita** — One of the most beautiful beaches in Colombia, just a 10-minute walk away
- **Real food** — Fresh seafood, tropical fruits, and Colombian cuisine
- **Starlink WiFi** — At Cabaña Sancibrian, you can catch up on emails and let your family know you survived the crossing
- **Hot showers and comfortable beds** — After sleeping on a sailboat, our queen beds feel like clouds

> "We planned to stay one night in Sapzurro and ended up staying a week. The cabin, the beach, the village — it's the hidden gem of the entire route." — Sarah, from Germany

## What to Pack

- **Seasickness medication** — Dramamine or natural alternatives. The open ocean crossing can be rough
- **Dry bags** — Your belongings will get wet. Guaranteed
- **Reef-safe sunscreen** — Protect both yourself and the coral
- **Cash (USD and COP)** — ATMs are scarce in San Blas and Sapzurro
- **Light layers** — Nights on the boat can be surprisingly cool
- **Snorkeling gear** — Some boats provide it, but having your own is better

## How Much Does It Cost?

Expect to pay between **$400-600 USD** per person for the full San Blas to Cartagena sailing trip. This typically includes:

- Transport from Panama City to San Blas
- 2-3 nights on the boat
- All meals during the sailing
- Captain and crew

**Not included:** Immigration fees (~$20), Guna Yala tax (~$20), accommodation in Sapzurro or Cartagena.

## Immigration & Border Crossing

Since you're crossing an international border, you'll need:

1. **Passport** with at least 6 months validity
2. **Exit stamp from Panama** — Usually handled at a small office in the San Blas area
3. **Entry stamp for Colombia** — Immigration is available in Sapzurro

The process is straightforward but can take some time. Sapzurro has immigration offices, making it one of the most relaxed border crossings in the Americas.

## Best Time to Go

- **December to April** — Dry season, calmer seas, most boats running
- **May to November** — Wet season, rougher seas, fewer boats but better prices

The peak season is January to March, when the trade winds are most favorable.

## Book Your Sapzurro Stay

Whether you're stopping for one night or staying a week (like many of our guests end up doing), Cabaña Sancibrian is your home away from home on the San Blas to Cartagena route.

With **24/7 electricity**, **Starlink WiFi**, and beds that will make you forget you were ever on a sailboat, we're the perfect transition from adventure to comfort.
