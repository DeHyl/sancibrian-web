What if you could take a video call with your team at 7 AM, spend the afternoon snorkeling in the Caribbean, and close out a client proposal before sunset — all from the same spot?

That spot exists. It's called Sapzurro, and at Cabaña Sancibrian, we've built the infrastructure to make it possible.

## The Remote Work Paradox

Most remote destinations force you to choose: beauty *or* connectivity. A stunning beach with no signal. A mountain retreat where the power cuts out. A jungle cabin where uploading a file takes all afternoon.

Sapzurro sits in one of the most isolated corners of Colombia — no roads in, no roads out, surrounded by the Darién jungle and the Caribbean Sea. By every logic, it should have the worst internet in the country.

Instead, we built the opposite.

## The Sancibrian Trifecta: Three Systems, One Promise

At Cabaña Sancibrian, three technologies work together to give you something virtually no other remote destination offers: **genuine 24/7 connectivity with zero power interruptions**.

---

### ⚡ 1. BatX Backup Batteries — Power That Never Stops

![BatX backup battery system at Cabaña Sancibrian](/images/batx.webp)

Sapzurro runs on a municipal generator that, like most small Caribbean towns, has scheduled downtime and occasional failures. For most accommodations in the region, when the power goes out, everything stops.

Not at Sancibrian.

We installed a **BatX battery backup system** — a high-capacity energy storage solution that charges during grid hours and seamlessly takes over the moment grid power drops. The switchover is automatic and nearly instantaneous. You won't notice it happened.

**What this means for your workday:**

| Scenario | Most places in Sapzurro | Cabaña Sancibrian |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Nightly generator shutdown | Everything off | Fully powered |
| Unexpected grid failure | Blackout | No interruption |
| Long video call | Risk of cutoff mid-call | Stable to the end |
| Charging devices overnight | Not possible | Always available |
| Working at 2 AM | Dark and offline | Coffee and full power |

BatX batteries are made in Colombia, designed for exactly this kind of off-grid reliability — and they are the reason guests regularly tell us: *"I actually got more done here than in my regular office."*

### 🛜 2. Starlink Satellite Internet — Fast, Where Others Have Nothing

![Starlink satellite internet — available at Cabaña Sancibrian](/images/starlink.png)

Traditional internet in Sapzurro is limited and unreliable. Cell signal is weak to nonexistent. Most accommodation relies on the same slow, shared local connections.

We invested in **Starlink** — SpaceX's low-Earth-orbit satellite internet — because we believe that if you're going to work remotely, the internet should never be the limiting factor.

**Real performance numbers from Sancibrian:**

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Download speed | 80–180 Mbps |
| Upload speed | 10–30 Mbps |
| Latency | 25–60 ms |
| Video call quality | HD stable (Zoom, Meet, Teams) |
| Large file uploads | Fast — upload a 1GB video in minutes |
| Reliability | Near-continuous; minor drops during heavy rain |

**What you can actually do:**

- ✅ Back-to-back Zoom, Google Meet, or Teams calls
- ✅ Upload videos, design files, or code builds
- ✅ Stream music or Spotify while you work
- ✅ Use cloud apps (Notion, Figma, GitHub, Vercel, AWS) without issues
- ✅ VPN connections for corporate networks
- ✅ Two devices simultaneously without noticeable slowdown

### ☕ 3. The Hangar Café — Your Office in the Jungle

![The Hangar Café — Colombian coffee and coworking, 24/7](/images/cafe/interior-1.jpg)

A fast connection and reliable power are nothing without a comfortable place to actually sit down and work. That's where the **Hangar Café** comes in.

Named in honor of Captain Diego Domínguez Escobar — the aviator whose legacy inspired Cabaña Sancibrian — the Hangar Café is our on-site coffee shop and coworking space, available to guests **24 hours a day, 7 days a week**.

**What you'll find:**

- ☕ **Colombian specialty coffee** — freshly brewed cappuccinos, americanos, filtered coffee
- 🥐 **Breakfast and snacks** available at any hour — arepas, fruit plates, pastries
- 🪑 **Comfortable work tables** with good posture seating
- 💡 **Ample natural light** and warm artificial lighting for evening sessions
- 🌿 **A calm, distraction-free environment** — no street noise, no crowds
- 🎵 **Ambient music** curated for focus

![Colombian coffee at the Hangar Café](/images/cafe/coffee.jpg)

The Hangar Café is not a hotel lobby with two chairs. It's a proper space designed around the idea that great work deserves a great setting — and that the best espresso you've ever had shouldn't require a 30-minute commute.

## Who This Is For

The Sancibrian setup was built with specific types of remote workers in mind:

**Developers & engineers** who need stable upload speeds for deployments, commits, and video calls with distributed teams.

**Content creators** who upload high-resolution photos and videos and can't afford a slow connection eating half their day.

**Consultants & coaches** who run back-to-back video calls and need power and internet that simply won't fail during a client session.

**Startup founders & remote teams** doing off-site work retreats in a location that inspires, without sacrificing productivity.

**Freelancers & digital nomads** who are tired of cafés in overpriced cities and want to find out what it feels like to work from a Caribbean paradise.

Yes. The WiFi network handles multiple simultaneous connections — laptop, phone, and tablet at the same time without noticeable slowdown.

**Is there a desk in the cabin?**
Yes. The Captain's Cabin includes a spacious, dedicated work desk. Many guests prefer working from the cabin itself; others come to the Hangar Café for the social atmosphere.

**What if I need to print something or use a scanner?**
We can help coordinate this — let us know in advance and we'll find a solution.

**Are there phone calls that need quiet?**
The Hangar Café has a calm, low-noise environment. For calls requiring complete privacy, the cabin itself offers total quiet.
